# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition using DeepLearning-Yuvasri.K
In this project, we aim to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of digits
(0-9), represented as grayscale pixel values. We start by downloading the MNIST dataset from Yann LeCun's website, which includes files for training and testing images and labels. Custom functions are then utilized to load the images and labels into NumPy arrays, reshaping each image into a flat array of pixel values for easier processing. To improve the KNN algorithm's performance, the pixel values are normalized to a range between 0 and 1. The KNN classifier is implemented to learn associations between the images and their corresponding labels during training. Finally, the model's performance is evaluated on the testing dataset using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics, and visualizations are created to display some images alongside their predicted labels, allowing us to assess the model's classification results.
